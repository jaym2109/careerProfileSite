              <!-- <p>
                I've worked for the Macdonald Group of Companies for 6 years in
                the accounting department. Over the past two years I've slowly
                transitioned into more of an IT position. Currently my work consists of
                80 % I.T. work and 20 % accounting. It's never really been an
                easy task to define my position within the organization but
                based on my current responsibilities I likely fall under the
                categories of Business Analyst and Business Intelligence
                Developer.
              </p> -->
              <p>
                I've worked for the Macdonald Group of Companies for the past 6 years in
                the accounting department. While I've been considered a member of the accounting
                department I've taken on more of an IT/Accounting role with the corporation. I am involved
                in a majority of the traditional accounting procedures including budgeting, forecasting, strategic management, 
                fiscal period close-outs and financial prep. I've also taken on a more IT focused role involving
                programming small programs, software implementations, system administration, automating workflow, building ad-hoc reporting, 
                data analysis and business intelligence. At the end of the day I am an accountant by trade with more of an advanced technical
                skillset.

                <strong>Business Analyst</strong> <br />
                As the Business Analyst I have two major roles. I'm
                expected to manage the implementation and support of business information
                systems across multiple department and develop business intelligence solutions
                accross a wide array of business operations. I'm expected to identify problems
                and opportunities within the corporations and provide solutions that help achieve 
                the corporations goals.

              <h2 class="major">Education & Interests</h2>
              <p>
                I'm well educated in both Business and Accounting with diplomas
                from Fanshawe College in General Business and Accounting.
                Currently I'm pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Business Commerce
                with a major in Accounting on a part-time basis. I'm currently 6
                courses away from completing the program. Once complete I am planning
                on pursuing a masters degree or professional designation. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I've also taken an interest in data science, web development and programming
                and have integrated that interest into my daily workflows. I
                utilize non-tradional education such as DataCamp, Youtube and Udemy to
                learn new skills.

            <h2 class="major">What Have I Done For the Company?</h2>
            <p>
              Business is all about performance and I strive each day to help
              the business perform at it's peak levels. As the business analyst,
              it is my job to analyze business activity and provide
              both detailed reports and BI Solutions. Below are some of the more
              impactful accomplishments I've had at the company.

                <p>
                  Implementing Software is no easy task. I've taken project lead
                  on both of our major software migrations, from Jonas to
                  Viewpoint and now from Spruceware to Biztrack. I've also been
                  a major player in a majority of our business requirements
                  meetings and pursued new softwares including Microsoft
                  Dynamics, Power BI, Keystyle, and HR4.

                <p>
                  Power BI has become the forefront of our data solutions at
                  Macdonald Group of Companies. I've successfully integrated the
                  software and built reports and dashboards for financial
                  statements, forecasting, business operations, and sales and
                  marketing. I've taught other employees how to use the program
                  and consistently developed new and innovative Power BI
                  dashboards.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  I built a financial server from scratch that directly connects
                  to our SQL databases. This gives us the ability to generate "real time"
                  financials at the click of a button. Income Statements, Balance Sheets,
                  Cash Flows, Forecasts and Budget are all available on this server and 
                  filterable based on fiscal years, months and individual companies.

                <p>
                  A year ago I proposed major changes to our corporate
                  incentives plan. The change was made to help align employee
                  goals with the corporate goals. This plan included the
                  introduction of a Group RRSP plan, a corporate wide company
                  hierarchy leveling system with guidelines for bonus payouts
                  and salary ranges and a strategic initiative to align and
                  develop operational goals for each department/team/individual
                  and reward exceptional performance on an annual basis.
